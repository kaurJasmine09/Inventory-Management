Suitable use of the features of the programming languages:
-The project as a whole is a client-server web application as they don't require any installation on frontend device and only require a web browser. It is suitable for warehouse management as this job requires moving around frequently.
-Backend is a web service built with ASP.NET Core using Visual Studio as deployment onto Azure is made simple since both tools are developed by Microsoft.
-Frontend web client used React as it provides flexibility, good performance and reusable components.
Issues/Problems:
-Each member were only familiar with some of the chosen technologies and had to do their research as they work on the project.
-Team members have different development environments and had minor troubles with setting up the project. Backend web service could not be hosted on the lab computers at Douglas College - possibly due to security reason.
Suggestions:
-On how product are handled if come via container: it will have to be opened up and all the products inside will be checked. If the container are not to be opened as it being moved into the warehouse, the whole container will be treated as one product with details of its content put into the product's description.
-In case customers wanted to keep track of their product's location in the warehouse, the project can be extended to have a Storage Area entity. Product will have an attribute to track where they are stored and another attribute for how much space they occupied. Area can use these attribute to show how much space they have left to help warehouse manager with their management.
